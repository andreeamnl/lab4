<h2>There are a handful of scenarios that happen in my <i>Taxi System simulation.</i></h2>
<hr>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Once the client tries to request a taxi, he either:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Gets a response (Company is open for work)
   <li> Gets turned down (Company is not open for work)<ul/>
<h3>Once the client does in fact get a respons, he either:</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Is told to patiently wait for a cab (There are cars available)
   <li> Is told to try later (There are no cabs available)</ul>
<h3>Once the driver picks up the client, he may:</h3><ul>
  <li>Have no interaction with the officer
  <li>Get pulled over by police
  <li>Get pulled over and also fined
  <li>crash
  <li>"Hit and Run"</ul>
<h3>Once the client gets to the destination, he may either:</h3><ul>
  <li>Simply pay
  <li>*cough cough* not pay..</ul>
<h3>Once the driver decides to  pay, he may:</h3><ul>
  <li>Pick cash
  <li>Pick card
  <li>Finalize trasaction
  <li>Give feedback (Good but also bad)</ul>
<h3>Once the client decides to not pay, he may:</h3><ul>
  <li>Pretend to pay later
  <li>Lose his wallet
  <li>Rob the taxi driver</ul>
 </div>
 <p><h2>These scenarios run independendly and randomly for each of the 12 costumers trying to get home after a night out.</h2></p>
